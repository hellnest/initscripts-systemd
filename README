Arch Linux initscripts, butchered to run with systemd. The obvious goal here
is to let systemd do as much as possible.

rc.sysinit
----------
Sequentially:
1) RAID
2) LVM
	TODO: Both RAID and LVM need testers. The tools do not support hotplugging, so we might need to add some more synchronisation points to avoid races

Independently:
load modules: load the modules defined in rc.conf (TODO: incorporate this into arch-settings below)
nisdomainname: set domainname if the configuration file exists (TODO: can this be removed? what do other distros do?)

After root is mounted rw:
depmod (TODO: is this needed? how do other distros do this?)

rc.shutdown
-----------
arch-settings: parses and saves arch specific settings (e.g. rc.conf) in their respective distro independent places (rather than doing it on boot)
	TODO: add support for loading of modules and blacklisting of modules so load-modules.sh and similar magic is not needed.
