Arch Linux initscripts, butchered to run with systemd. The obvious goal here
is to let systemd do as much as possible.

rc.sysinit
----------
Sequentially:
1) RAID
2) LVM
	TODO: Both RAID and LVM need testers. The tools do not support hotplugging, so we might need to add some more synchronisation points to avoid races

rc.shutdown
-----------
arch-persistent-settings: parses and saves arch specific settings (e.g. rc.conf) in their respective distro independent places (rather than doing it on boot)
