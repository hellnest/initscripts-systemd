Arch Linux initscripts, butchered to run with systemd. The obvious goal here
is to let systemd do as much as possible. In the current state of the available
scripts, the following systemd units are necessary:

systemd-random-seed-save.service
systemd-random-seed-load.service
sysctl.service
hwclock-load.service
hwclock-save.service
udev.service

The AUR package will enable these for you upon installation.
